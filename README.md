Implementation of a node for the https://polkadot.network in Rust, using the Substrate framework. This directory
currently contains runtimes for the Polkadot, Kusama, Westend, and Rococo networks. In the future, these will be
relocated to the [`runtimes`](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/) repository.

Substrate is the primary blockchain SDK used by developers to create the parachains that make up the Polkadot network.
Additionally, it allows for the development of self-sovereign blockchains that operate completely independently of
Polkadot.
