## [Getting Started](./substrate/)

 [![Substrate-license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL3%2FApache2.0-blue)](./substrate/README.md#LICENSE)

Substrate is the primary blockchain SDK used by developers to create the parachains that make up the Polkadot network.
Additionally, it allows for the development of self-sovereign blockchains that operate completely independently of
Polkadot.

## [Cumulus](./cumulus/)
